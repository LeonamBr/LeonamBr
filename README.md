### Hi ðŸ‘‹, i'm Leonam

I am a petroleum engineering student at UENF and a java backend developer.

## I love to

Without a doubt, I love to learn. learning new things always makes me very excited and happy so I'm always looking for new things and improving on what I already have mastered as technology requires it.
I also love gastronomy, and just like technology I love learning new recipes for meals as well as eating delicious things.
I like martial arts and I practiced karate for a long time when I was young.

## Why did I start with software development?

As a child I loved video games and as soon as I got my first computer I wanted to know how games were made and I ended up bumping into my first barrier to learning to program which was math. :rofl: :zany_face:

## Where did I learn to program?

In the course of petroleum engineering we have a huge need to create simulation software, as all costs in all oil exploration and production operations are very expensive, everything has to be properly tested before starting oil exploration and production. so, in this course we developed several scientific software, from seismic signal filtering software, rock grain counting, organic matter molecule counter, to mathematical interactions and numerical inversions.

## What language do I use for scientific software development?

c++ , is a low-level object-oriented language that is perfect for this kind of problems, its compilation and execution speed is one of the best making it perfect for simulation and implementation of complex math problems.

## Education

I graduated from the Dr Sylvio Bastos Tavares State School in Campos dos Goytacazes.

I am trained as a computer technician at the former CEFET - Federal Center for Technological Education (currently IFF)

I am under graduation from the state University of Northern Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro(UENF) in oil exploration and production engineering.

## Experiences

### Scientific initiation scholarship

During my scientific initiation I developed a software that calculates the area of a water sheet contaminated by oil, I used the C++ language with OOP (Object Oriented Programming) and several mathematical algorithms in this project, I also used the GNUPLOT library to create a filter based on the color response of the images injected into the software seen in a histogram, thus quantifying the area of oil that affected the water slide, thus helping to verify the power of the product to clean the water polluted by oil.

### Trainee SPE UENF Student Chapter

During my period as a trainee at the SPE UENF Student Chapter I was responsible for the production and maintenance of the website, as well as responsible for other marketing matters, the chapter's web page was all built in CSS and with JS elements.

### Member of the Organizing Committee of XV ENGEP

During the organization of the event, my whole year was dedicated to getting an exceptional view for the event, I coordinated a small team of 5 colleagues and we created several strategies to publicize our event. The result of our efforts gave us more than 700 participations in the academic event, which was until then the record of registrations for the event.

### Pre Vest UENF

One of the best experiences of my life, I was able to dedicate a little of my time to contribute to this social project that enabled me to pass an engineering course that was the most popular at the time, in this project I was a math and physics teacher for students of low income to help them with their dream of entering a university.

### Google

For a long time I was an ad analyst for Google where I was able to earn some income through micro tasks of analyzing advertisements, the system aims to filter which advertisements can be shown to the public and prevent fake news from reaching users.

So that's it folks, remember, drink water, eat fruit and move on.

***Have a great day***.
